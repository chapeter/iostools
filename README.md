Simple tools for IOS

expose: Does a quick static PAT translation.  Retains the last entry and will automatically remove it when you run the program again.  Some manual changes will be done to get this to go through your device's login sequence

You can prime expose by filling out the expose.cfg file before you run it...then you only need to supply the insideaddress, insideport, and outsideport arguments
